# Shooting

### Perform a Test Run

Set up your kit as described in the previous sections.

Turn the camera on, ensuring it is in the correct shooting mode and setting.

If using a backpack, put the pack on, and secure the straps to keep it from moving around too much. These straps also help compensate for the load of the pack too.

Similarly, if using a helmet, make sure it is tight to your head to stop it moving around.

Now remove the lens caps.

Either use the app, voice control, or if possible reach up and press the start button \(red circle outline\) and walk around your house / garden / neighbourhood. If using the dive pack, follow the start/stop instructions detailed in “[setting up the scuba dive pack](kit-setup.md#setting-up-the-scuba-dive-pack)”.

After a few minutes, stop the filming by pressing the start button again. The camera should show a number \(the number of photos taken on your test tour. Note, this number is cumulative and will show the number of photos taken in total\).

Turn off the camera, and remove the micro SD cards. Place the microSD card in the microSD card USB reader and insert into your computer.

You should see the photos you’ve just shot \(.jpg’s if timelapse photo\). To view them as interactive 360 images you can use the [GoPro VR Player](https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/download/audio-video-photo/gopro-vr-player-305-3330891/) \(note, this is no longer supported by GoPro\).

Eject the microSD card USB reader from your computer, replace the SD Card in the camera, and do the same thing with the second microSD card.

If everything appears to be working correctly, it’s time to shoot.

### Before You Leave the House

This part is written from bitter experience -- turning up, excited to start filming, and realising I’ve forgotten something.

Now I perform the following checks before leaving home:

1. Are the batteries fully charged and is one in the camera? Have you packed a spare?
2. Do the MicroSD cards have enough free space for everything you plan to shoot? Are they both in the camera?
3. Is the monopod in/on the pack \(including GoPro mounts and screws\)?
4. Have you enabled GPS mode? Is the time correct for your location?
5. Is time-lapse mode on the correct interval for the type of transport you will use to shoot?
6. What is the weather like? Have you checked the best source of weather information available for the location?

You should also consider safety. Have you got the right gear for the environment? Are you prepared for changes in the weather? Are you going out with a friend? Does someone at home know your plans? Have you packed water and food?

### Capturing a Tour

Put on the pack, set the mode to time-lapse \(ensuring the settings are correct\), give the camera a minute for the GPS to lock on and start the capture.

You don’t need any more instructions -- you’re now an expert on the Trek Pack. Though here are some recommendations based on personal experience:

* Make sure to remove the lens caps on the camera before shooting
* When shooting, try not to move your torso around too much, but remember to enjoy the environment around you too.
* Be prepared for questions. Many people will be intrigued by your Trek Pack. We encourage Trekkers to share what they’re doing with others, and why. Many people will, rightly, be concerned about their privacy. Be prepared to explain how your photos will be used.
* Make sure you comply with local laws around public photography too. Generally don’t shoot on private property or around children, but make sure you know what is and isn’t allowed beforehand.

### Processing and publishing

Make sure to keep make a copy of the images on the microSD card on your computer, and back them up.

Don't forget to recharge any batteries ready for the next adventure too.

You can use the [Map the Paths Desktop Uploader](http://mtp.trekview.org/uploader) to process and publish the images to various online services.
