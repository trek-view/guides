# Challenges

### About

Challenges encourage other users to help improve the map.

There are two types of challenges

* Image capture: creating and uploading sequences that meet Challenge criteria
* Image labelling: tagging images that meet Challenge criteria

#### Image capture challenge

An image capture challenge encourages street-level photographers to capture photos in a defined location, and/or using a defined transport type,  and/or using a defined camera over a defined time period.

For example, an image capture challenge might be set to map all London bike lanes by bike in 2020. Every sequence/image on Map the Paths that falls within the challenge criteria will earn the user that uploaded them points against that Challenge.

#### Image label challenge

An image labelling challenge encourages Map the Paths users to help improve automatic detection in images.

For example, an image labelling challenge might be to identify Oak Trees in southern England. Every sequence/image on Map the Paths that falls within the challenge criteria will earn users points for every Oak tree they identify.
