# Challenges

### About

A challenge encourages street-level photographers to capture photos in a defined location, and/or using a defined transport type,  and/or using a defined camera over a defined time period.

For example, a Challenge might be set to map all London bike lanes by bike in 2020. Every sequence/image on Map the Paths that falls withing the challenge criteria will earn the user that uploaded them points against that Challenge.
