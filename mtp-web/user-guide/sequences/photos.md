# Photos

### About

It is useful to have a human searchable record of what is inside an image. For example; show me all photos that contain cars.

This is where Photo Tags come in.

### Types of tags

There are two types of photo tags you will come across in Map the Paths Web:

1. Mapillary Object tags: these are tags auto-extracted by Mapillary technology. [You can read more about these types of tags and where they come from in the developer docs](../../developer-docs/functions/photos.md#get-mapillary-photo-object-data).
2. MTP Object tags: these are tags that have been added to images manually by Map the Paths users. These types of tags are covered in this article.

### Viewing MTP Object tags

\[ADD image\]

When in Photo view, you will see all object tags \(both Mapillary and MTP tags\) in the sidebar. Clicking a tag will highlight that object\(s\) in the photo viewer.

### Mark MTP Object

\[ADD image\]

You might notice objects that have not been tagged in an image. In which case, you can add them youself.

To do this select Add Tag and draw the tag using the polygon creation tool.

Once the Polygon has been drawn, select the parent tag category and the associated child tag.

If you don't see the type of tag you want to add, [you can create a Challenge](../challenges/). This will not only add the tag to our tag database, but also encourage others to use this tag across all Map the Paths imagery.
