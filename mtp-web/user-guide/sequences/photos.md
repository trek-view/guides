# Photos

### About

Every sequence consists of two or more images \(Photos\). Photos are either 2D or 360 imported from Mapillary.

Photos can only belong to one sequence.

It is useful to have a human searchable record of what is inside an image. For example; show me all photos that contain cars.

Photos therefore have 4 types of associated metadata

* Sequence data: the sequence information for the sequence they belong to
* Image data: such as capture time, camera type, etc.
* Image detections / features \(Mapillary\): object and feature detections discovered by Mapillary
* Image labels: labels added to images by MTPW users

### Sequence data

Because each image belongs to a sequence, it inherits the sequence data.

### Image data

This data is essentially the metadata added to the image when it was taken and/or processed.

### Image detections / features \(Mapillary\)

You'll see Mapillary detections that have been reported by Mapillary for the image.

You can read more about Mapillary:

* [Object detections](https://help.mapillary.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000967191-Object-detections)
* [Map features](https://help.mapillary.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002332165)

### Image labels

When in Photo view, you will be able to see image labels other MTPW users have applied.

You can also add your own labels by tracing around the object you wish to label in the image.

Clicking an image label in the left hand menu will highlight that label in the Photo viewer.

#### Label an object

![MTPW add a label](../../../.gitbook/assets/b1e50ba1-4e83-4655-8d70-1bd7490aedc6.png)

You might notice objects that have not been labelled in an image. In which case, you can add them yourself.

To do this select Add Label and draw the outline of the object using the polygon creation tool.

Once the Polygon has been drawn, select the parent label category and the associated child label.

If you don't see the type of label you want to add, [you can create a Challenge](challenges/). This will not only add the label to our label database, but also encourage others to use this label across all Map the Paths imagery.
