# Capture

### About

Map the Path lets anyone capture their own street-level imagery, using simple cameras such as smartphones, action cameras, and 360° cameras.

All you need is a way to record GPS data together with the images, and a lot of cameras nowadays have that option built in. In addition to the camera, there is other equipment such as mounts and SD cards that you might want to use for a smoother capture process.

Here is an overview of the kinds of devices and equipment you can work with.

### Devices

Map the Paths supports both 2D and 360 imagery \(recommended\) captured using:

* **Mobile phones** A smartphone is the simplest device you can use for capturing and uploading images. Mobile phones are best for scenarios where you intend to mount a device inside your vehicle’s windshield or walk with the phone. 
* **Action cameras** Action cameras are a good option for capturing great images, especially more demanding conditions with rough terrain, extreme weather, and high speeds. Compared to smartphones, action cameras are better at handling motion blur and more resistant to damage, so they're suitable for mounting on your bicycle or outside your vehicle. 
* **360° cameras \(recommended\)** 360° cameras are great for covering all directions simultaneously. You can capture 360° imagery while driving a vehicle or walking. 

### Other equipment

* **Mounts** For each device and use case, there are different suitable mounting methods.
  * For capturing while driving, it is best to use a windshield mount for mobile phones inside vehicles, whereas it is best to mount action cameras and 360° cameras on the outside of vehicles.
  * For multiple camera angles, you can mount several action cameras and 360° cameras at once.
  * For capturing with the mobile phone while walking, you just hold it steady horizontally in front of you. For action cameras, it is best to use a body mount \(chest or head\), and a selfie stick for 360° cameras.
* **Memory/SD cards** It is important to have enough memory on your device to store your photos after capturing. Mobile phones should have enough internal storage. One image takes roughly 2–8 MB, giving you about 1000–4000 images if you have 8 GB of free storage on your phone. For devices like action cameras and 360° cameras, we recommend inserting an SD card with around 128 GB, so you can capture as many images possible.
* **Charging** It is important to fully charge all of your devices prior to capturing. When you have multiple devices to charge prior to capturing, we recommend a multi-port USB charging station, although this is optional.
* **Power supply** It is equally important to keep your devices powered during your capture session. For shorter sessions, your device’s internal battery may be sufficient to last the duration of your session. For longer sessions, consider an external charging pack for each device, or a car charger if your situation allows for it.
* **Protective cases** Most action cameras are built to withstand rough conditions. If you want to protect your device further, you may buy a protective case for it.
* **Drones** Map the Paths supports drone imagery. Use a suitable camera that can handle vibration, for example, GoPro. Mounting phones on drones is not a good idea because of the rolling shutter effects from vibration. 

### Capture modes

For Map the purposes it’s best to capture images in timelapse mode \(e.g. 1 photo every 2 seconds\), not video, because you save a lot on data volume, battery life, reviewing and upload time.

Although the preferred way to contribute to Map the Paths is to upload geotagged images, it is also possible to upload videos to Map the Paths using the [Map the Paths Desktop Uploader](http://mtp.trekview.org/uploader). In that case, the video will be turned into images during the process. This is useful for situations when you are capturing for more than Map the Paths purposes—like when you are using a downhill run to share with friends, but also want to use it for mapping purposes.

The Map the Paths Desktop Uploader supports both timelapse and video uploads.

### How to capture great images

Regardless of whether capturing with your mobile phone or some other camera, there are a few basic rules for capturing for Map the Paths. 

#### 5 basic rules for capturing

* The main point when capturing is to **keep on moving** and to try to **hold the camera still, pointing in one direction**.
* Map the Paths supports **images in landscape orientation**. Adjust the **camera to be level with the horizon**.
* Normally you **aim the camera towards the direction of movement**, where the road in front of you meets the horizon.
* The ideal environment for a Map the Paths sequence is to have the **sun behind you**, **minimal traffic** and **fewer people about**.
* Take **many images in one sequence** \(at least 10, but more is better\) and in **close proximity to each other** \(5 m is good\).

#### General tips

* Avoid capturing in the rain and in low-light situations. The images will turn out much worse than what you see with the human eye. \(This particularly applies when you're in a car.\)
* Keep a consistent angle of the camera. Most times you would keep it pointing straight ahead, although sometimes you may want to capture e.g. at a 90- or 45-degree angle with respect to your direction of moving. If you change the camera angle mid-capture, the sequences will end up looking jumpy and "dizzy".
* If you keep or mount the camera steady, you can lock the compass angle to the direction your device is pointing, instead of using the device's compass that might be affected by disturbances. There's a little arrow or compass icon at the top right of the app's Capture screen for changing that this setting.
* Turn off WiFi and Bluetooth to save battery while you capture. You might want to use a power bank \(or a phone charger, if in a car\) for extra power supply.
* For longer capture sessions, consider extra micro-SD cards to expand the memory available for capture \(if your device supports it\).
* Keep in mind that if you capture images that are several hundreds of meters apart from each other, they will be split into separate sequences after upload on our system. This may make it inconvenient for you to get an overview of your imagery later \(both in the list on your profile and visualised on the map, where they'll only be represented by single dots\).

#### Walking tips

* Try to keep the camera in line with the horizon. It's a bit harder when walking compared to other modes of moving, but the tilt lines on the camera screen will help you.
* You can try putting the phone in a pouch around your neck or taped on your chest. That should help keep the camera steady.
* You might also try to use a selfie stick which might be more comfortable to hold than the phone itself.
* Normally you would use an automatic capture mode. However, you can also use the manual mode if you for some reason want custom control over when an image is captured.
* For example, the manual mode might be a good idea if your images turn out blurry—try stopping for each image you take.

#### Cycling tips

* Ride slow and preferably on smooth surfaces. This has two reasons: to reduce blur that results from shocks absorbed by the bike and to make sure your phone doesn’t pop out of the holder.
* To be on the safe side, we strongly suggest that you use rubber bands or lanyards to secure your phone to the mount.

Note. Mobile phones are not the best choice when you want to capture while cycling. One reason is that your phone may quite easily pop out of the mount and get damaged. The other reason is that phones are usually not good at handling motion blur. We recommend that you use an action camera instead.

#### Driving tips

* The position of the mount also affects potential glare from the dashboard \(that will be visible in your images\). You can also try a few other tricks for reducing glare:
  * Remove any lighter objects from your dashboard.
  * Cover the dashboard with a black matt cloth \(like felt\).
  * Try a DIY polarizer filter. You can use a lens from disposable 3D glasses from the cinema—cut it out and tape it over your camera lens. You might want to try rotating and turning it around to find the position that works best for you.
* You can achieve really good results in terms of both quantity and quality of images by using an action camera or a rig of several cameras that you mount externally to the car.
